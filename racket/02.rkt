; Problem #2
; Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
; previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

; 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

; By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
; exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

(define (fibonacci i)
  (let aux [(in 1) (out 0) (index i)]
    (if (< index 0)
      out
      (aux (+ in out) in (- index 1)))))

(define (generate-fibonacci-sequence n)
  (let aux [(lim n) (in 1) (out '())]
    (let ((cur (fibonacci in)))
      (if (>= cur lim)
        out
        (aux lim (+ 1 in) (cons cur out))))))

; Solution
(foldr + 0 (filter even? (generate-fibonacci-sequence 4000000)))
